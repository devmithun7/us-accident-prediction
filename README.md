# USA Road Accidents Severity Prediction

## Project Overview
The Accident Severity Classifier project applies machine learning techniques to sort 7 million records into four categories of accident severity. This project encompasses comprehensive feature engineering, hyper-parameter tuning, and meticulous evaluation with metrics such as ROC, accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, it integrates advanced data visualization through Tableau, enabling the creation of interactive dashboards that facilitate the extraction of critical insights and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) essential for informed strategic decision-making. Our objective is to provide a robust tool for enhancing safety measures and supporting data-driven decisions in the realm of accident management and prevention.

## Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves cleaning, handling missing values, label encoding, and boolean mapping.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new attributes from timestamps like day, month, hour, and accident duration.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Includes oversampling for data imbalance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Focus on precision, recall, F1-score, support, and accuracy.

## Results
The project identifies Logistic Regression (before oversampling) as the most effective model based on evaluation metrics.
